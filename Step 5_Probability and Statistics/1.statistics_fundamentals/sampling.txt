In this first mission, our focus will be on the details around getting data for analysis.

1. Introduction
   > Getting data >> understand how data is structured and measured >> organise data in comprehensiblee forms to find patterns 
      >> visulaise patterns
  
2. Solving Problems with Statistics
   > Using statistical techniques, we can organize, summarize, and visualize large amounts of data to 
     find patterns that otherwise would remain hidden.
   
3. Population and Samples
  > In statistics, the set of all individuals relevant to a particular statistical question is called a population.
  > A smaller group selected from a population is called a sample. When we select a smaller group from a population we do sampling.
  > Whether a set of data is a sample or a population depends on the question we're trying to answer 
  > Elements of a population referred to as individuals, units, events, observations. These are all used interchangeably 
    and refer to the same thing: the individual parts of a population. When we use the term "population individuals",the population is 
    not necessarily composed of people. "Individuals" here is a general term that could refer to people, needles, frogs, stars, etc.
  > In the case of a sample,terminology used interchangeably: sample unit, sample point, sample individual, or sample observation.

4. Sampling Error
  > A sample is by definition an incomplete set of data for the question we're trying to answer. For this reason, there's 
    almost always some difference between the metrics of a population and the metrics of a sample.
  > This difference can be seen as an error, and because it's the result of sampling, it's called sampling error.
  > A metric specific to a population is called a parameter, while one specific to a sample is called a statistic.
  > sampling error= parameter -statistic
  
5. Simple Random Sampling
   > When we sample we want to minimize the sampling error as much as possible. 
     We want our sample to mirror the population as closely as possible.
   > If a sample is representative, then the sampling error is low. The more representative a sample is, the smaller the sampling error. 
     The less representative a sample is, the greater the sampling error.
   > To make our samples representative, we can try to give every individual in the population an equal chance to be selected in our samples.
     To give every individual an equal chance of being picked, we need to sample randomly.
   > One way to perform random sampling is to generate random numbers and use them to select a few sample units from the population. 
     In statistics, this sampling method is called simple random sampling, SRS
   > Series.sample() to sample,this method performs simple random sampling by generating an array of random numbers, 
    and then using those numbers to select values from a Series at the indices corresponding to those random numbers. 
    The method can be also extended for DataFrame objects, where random rows or columns can be sampled.

6. Importance of Sample Size
   > Because sample means vary a lot around the population mean, there's a good chance we get a sample that is not
     representative of the population:
   > This problem can be solved by increasing the sample size. As we increase the sample size,
     the sample means vary less around the population mean, and the chances of getting an unrepresentative sample decrease.
   > Simple random sampling is not a reliable sampling method when the sample size is small. 
     Because sample means vary a lot around the population mean, there's a good chance we'll get an unrepresentative sample.
   > When we do simple random sampling, we should try to get a sample that is as large as possible. A large sample decreases 
     the variability of the sampling process, which in turn decreases the chances that we'll get an unrepresentative sample.

7. Stratified Sampling
   > Because simple random sampling is entirely random, it can leave out certain population individuals
     that are of great interest to some of the questions we may have.
   > To ensure we end up with a sample that has observations for all the categories of interest
     We can organize our data set into different groups, and then do simple random sampling for every group.
   > This sampling method is called stratified sampling, and each stratified group is also known as a stratum.
